 Globbing

   also called filename substitution or filename expansion

   wildcards also called globs 


* - matches any combination of zero or more characters
    for ex:-
     k* k followed by zero or any number of characters.    k , kk , k211 , kajshsh  , k11hjch322
     k*p k followed by zero or any number of characters, followed by p.      kp , kahgsgp , k1424ddp , kh2hk44kp
 
? - matches exactly one character
    for ex:-
     k?  k followed by any single character.    ka , k1 , k. , k3
     ?k  single character followed by k.        1k , sk , dk , 0k
     k?p k followed by any single character followed by p.   kap , k1p , k0p 
     chapter?? chapter followed by 2 character.    chapter23 , chapterXX , chapter01
     ??? filenames with 3 characters only
     ???* filenames with 3 or more characters

[] - character class

      filesnames that start with letter from a to k and end with a digit                  [a-k]*[0-9]
      filesnames that start with letter from a to k or u to z and end with a digit        [a-ku-z]*[0-9]
      filenames that don't start with an x,y,z         [!xyz]*
      filenames that don't start with a digit          [!0-9]*


   
  Named character classes 
  
  [[:lower:]]    matches lower case letters 
  [[:upper:]]    matches upper case letters 
  [[:alpha:]]    matches both lower and upper case letter 
  [[:digit:]]    matches digits
  [[:alnum:]]    matches lowercase , uppercase and digits
  [[:space:]]    matches whitespace characters like spaces, tabs , newlines



  Instead of copying the file we cn create links.
   
    there are two types of link :- hard link , soft or symbolic link 
   
  Hard link :- it is simply  giving multiple names to physical file. it is only created in local file system.
               we cannot create hard links for directories.		
               If you need to remove a file you need to erase all its hard links.
               command :- ln filename linkname

               Regarding link creation , hardlink
                when there is a already a file exist which has a similar name of your provided linkname
                then the terminal shows error in that case you have two commands for creation of a linkname.

                1) create link by force, this will create a link with same name but will override the 
                   previous/existing file. 
                   command :-  ln -f filename linkname

                2) but if don't want you to delete or override existing file with a same file name then you 
                   can you use backup command this will create a backup file. 
                   command :- ln --backup filename linkname   

  Symbolic link :- It is a physical file pointing to another file in a directory structure. It can be created 
                   in across different file system. we can create symbolic links for directories.You can remove symbolic links it didn't affect the actual file but if you delete the actual  file then there is no use of symbolic link as symbolic link redirects the actual file and when you delete the actual file it will redirect a non existing file.
                   command :- ln -s filename linkname


1) Always use tab for auto completion of any command
2) Always use double tab to know inside of any folder/directory
3) Always use arrow buttons for previous commands
4) To rename a file/directory you can also use mv command 
5) Source :- full path	
6) Destination :- full path
7) Absoute path :-from one directory to another directory (full path) , 
                  for ex:- ~/manish/workspace/test/
8) Relative path :-from one directory to another directory (full path) ,
                   for ex:- ../Desktop/unixstuff/ test/
